			<span><span>Research data management (RDM) is currently a concern for both researchers and funding agencies. On the&nbsp;researchers&#39; side, there&nbsp;is a growing awareness of the value of the data created or collected in research contexts:&nbsp;papers with associated data get more&nbsp;citations, while valuable data attracts collaboration. Funding agencies, on the&nbsp;other hand, are establishing the mandates for data&nbsp;curation plans and data sharing as part of call regulations.<br />
			<br />
			But research data management still has to be established as an integral part of research projects.<br />
			This is already the case in areas such as the life sciences, where big projects such as the human genome have been&nbsp;built on custom&nbsp;databases from the start. Small research groups in the so&shy;called long&shy;tail of science lack the technology&nbsp;to address data&nbsp;management, but they have the potential to generate very large amounts of valuable and unique&nbsp;data in their domains.<br />
			<br />
			Results in RDM require the concern with both technological and conceptual issues.<br />
			The technological problems have to do with storage, but also with the interfaces for organizing, describing and&nbsp;depositing data.&nbsp;Conceptual problems have to do with description. Data stored in an infrastructure, no matter how&nbsp;solid, will be useless without the&nbsp;organization and description that only data creators can provide, and that will allow&nbsp;other domain experts to reuse the data.<br />
			<br />
			The goal of the project is to bridge the gap between the data mandates which research groups are faced with and the&nbsp;available&nbsp;tools, workflows and description models. By the end of the 3&shy;year project, there will be a panel of research&nbsp;groups that have&nbsp;successfully managed the datasets they were creating and who also reaped the benefits of having&nbsp;their data published, findable and&nbsp;cited. Such success stories are still lacking in the community and their lessons are&nbsp;invaluable for the progress of research data&nbsp;management. The project findings will be followed by the participating&nbsp;university, who will take part in the test of the selected tools,&nbsp;with the goal of adopting them in stable supporting&nbsp;services.<br />
			<br />
			Our research questions are:<br />
			<br />
			<strong>RQ1.</strong> Do the available open&shy;source solutions for data repositories provide the technology for setting up a full&shy;fledged&nbsp;data&nbsp;management workflow for a university with research groups in many domains?<br />
			<br />
			<strong>RQ2.</strong> To what extent does the inclusion of a data repository in a registry such as re3data, and the indexing of&nbsp;metadata records, as&nbsp;LOD, by aggregators such as LOD4All, increase the visibility of research datasets?<br />
			<br />
			<strong>RQ3</strong>. Is it possible to assess the quality of the metadata for a dataset, and verify that it is complete enough to enable&nbsp;an&nbsp;autonomous use by an interested researcher?<br />
			<br />
			<strong>RQ4</strong>. How far can metadata be automated, so that the description task does not become a burden on researchers?<br />
			<br />
			<strong>RQ5</strong>. Do the proposed RDM workflows comply with the Portuguese and European data deposit and open access&nbsp;mandates and&nbsp;policies?<br />
			<br />
			The project team includes a group from INESC TEC who has preliminary work in the development of a data curation&nbsp;environment&nbsp;and in the design of ontology&shy;based metadata models for research data, as well as in the EPOS and&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=pt-PT&amp;q=http://WindScanner.eu&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1482964091235000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHYlYosrMqtzxqz3XhjEx6YgRkgdQ" href="http://WindScanner.eu" target="_blank">WindScanner.eu</a> European&nbsp;infrastructures. The group from the University of Porto have a strong interest in the results&nbsp;of the project as the management of&nbsp;research data is part of their mission at the university level. The group from&nbsp;InBIO has been involved in the definition of metadata&nbsp;standards for the biodiversity domain and is now leading the&nbsp;Portuguese consortium for the LifeWatch European e&shy;Science&nbsp;infrastructure for biodiversity and ecosystem research.<br />
			<br />
			The project has two well&shy;identified lines of work. The first is technological and involves the selection and integration of&nbsp;tools for the&nbsp;TAIL data management workflow. The required developments are strong in tool integration and&nbsp;deployment, taking the DENDRO&nbsp;platform for data description, the LabTablet metadata collection&nbsp;app and data repository&nbsp;platforms to provide a friendly data management&nbsp;environment for researchers.<br />
			<br />
			The second is experimental and uses the TAIL environment and a panel of researchers to perform data management&nbsp;experiments&nbsp;where existing datasets are selected, described and deposited. The challenge here lies in the design of&nbsp;the experiments, the&nbsp;engagement of the researchers, and in the provision of datasets. The experiments provide&nbsp;answers to the research questions, but&nbsp;they also result in a contribution to the asset of registered datasets, almost&nbsp;void in Portugal and overall still scarce.</span></span></div>

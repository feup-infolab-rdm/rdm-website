			<span><span>Research data management (RDM) is currently a concern for both researchers and funding agencies, still to be established as an integral part of research projects.  <br />
			<br />
			Funding agencies are establishing the mandates for data management and sharing as part of call regulations, while researchers are growing awareness of the benefits of data publication: papers with associated data get more citations, while valuable data attracts collaboration.<br />
			
			Small research groups, in the so-called long-tail of science, have the potential to generate very large amounts of valuable and unique data, but they often lack the support to address data management. <br />
			<br />
			To be effective RDM need to address both technological and conceptual issues. On the technological side are platforms that can assist in data organization, deposit and preservation. While conceptual issues have to do with data description. Data stored in an infrastructure, no matter how solid, will be useless without the description that only data creators can provide. Such descriptions may help others to interpret and reuse the data.<br />
			<br />
			The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between the data mandates which research groups are faced with and the available tools, workflows and description models. The project has two well identified lines of work. The first involves the selection and integration of tools for the TAIL data management workflow. The second is experimental and uses the TAIL environment and a panel of researchers to perform data management experiments where existing datasets are selected, described and deposited.<br />
			<br />
			The project team includes a group from INESC TEC who has preliminary work in the development of a data curation environment and in the design of ontologybased metadata models for research data, as well as in the EPOS and <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=pt-PT&amp;q=http://WindScanner.eu&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1482964091235000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHYlYosrMqtzxqz3XhjEx6YgRkgdQ" href="http://WindScanner.eu" target="_blank">WindScanner.eu</a> European infrastructures. The group from the University of Porto have a strong interest in the results of the project as the management of research data is part of their mission at the university level. The group from InBIO has been involved in the definition of metadata standards for the biodiversity domain and is now leading the Portuguese consortium for the LifeWatch European eScience infrastructure for biodiversity and ecosystem research.<br />

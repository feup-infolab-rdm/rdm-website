      <title>DATA MANAGEMENT</title>
      <link>https://rdm.up.pt/Resources%20Tools%20Data%20Management%20Dendro/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dendro is a collaborative tool developed under the scope of a doctoral thesis in the Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto with the aim to help researchers to integrate the data management in the research workflow. Its essence relies in the use of specific domain ontologies to describe the data created so that this remains “alive” for a long period of time. This means that data becomes sharable at the end of the research process and re-usable by other researchers.
Dendro interacts with Ckan, the digital platform where the University of Porto implemented its data repository - at the end of a research process, the authors send the final datasets and some privileged metadata to Ckan, where data will be available for future reuse in accordance to the licenses chosen by their authors.&lt;br /&gt;
Dendro is currently being tested with research groups of the University of Porto.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RESEARCH MANAGERS</title>

&lt;p&gt;Research data managers play a key role throughout research projects in ensuring that data is usable in the future. They provide guidance to researchers in preparing data for sharing by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing assistance with the preparation of data management plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suggesting the use of metadata standards to enable the reuse of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing guidance in the use of online tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identificating the appropriate repository to publish the research outputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electing the appropriate licenses, considering the type of data involved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section contains answers to the most frequently asked questions posed by research data managers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-data-should-be-published&#34;&gt;What data should be published?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All kind of data are candidate for sharing, but unique data or expensive to generate are especially important; they may become a valuable asset. As a minimum, it should be published the research data that are expected to be valuable to others, that can testify and validate findings, and that help researchers to increase recognition in the community. Moreover, the contracts signed between researchers and funder agencies establihs the requirements of data deposit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-data-curation&#34;&gt;What is data curation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data curation involves maintaining, preserving and adding value to data research troughout the data life cycle, reducing the threat of devaluation, or even data loss. It also reduces duplication of effort in creating research data, freeing researchers to other activities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DATA CURATORS</title>
      <link>https://rdm.up.pt/stakeholders/2015/06/24/data-curators/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Data curators have a key role in ensuring that data remain understandable and usable in the future. In the absence of a previous data management plan, they are expected to add the necessary metadata to datasets that have none, or almost none, contextualization or description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main activities endorsed to data curators are related to the data that are going to be published (or they are already published) in data repositories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promotion of best practices throughout the research process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping researchers to decide how to publish data at the end of projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definition of the required quality control steps to integrate data in a repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation and managing of metadata necessary to describe data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making data visible and available to defined target audiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuring that the access to data complies to the licenses chosen by the authors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving advice on data that have a long-term value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definition and implementation of rules and procedures to guarentee the long term preservation of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dissemination of successful stories to encourage the practice of sharing data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;which-metadata-standards-can-i-recommend-to-researchers&#34;&gt;Which metadata standards can I recommend to researchers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many metadata standards available to promote data discovery, preservation and reuse. Metadata standards can either be generic or developed within a specific community in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are some of the metadata standards that data curators may recommend for data description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CERIF&lt;/code&gt; â€“ Common European Research Information Format â€“ This standard is a EU recommendation to its member states for recording research activity related information. It is developed and mantained by EuroCRIS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Darwin Core&lt;/code&gt; â€“  A body of standards, that include a glossary of terms, that targets data sharing  in the biological diversity domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;DDI Data Documentation Initiative&lt;/code&gt; â€“ A widely used standard for describing data from the social, behavioural and economic sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;DIF Directory Interchange Format&lt;/code&gt; â€“ An initiative from Earth sciences community for the description of scientific data, with elements that represent the instruments used to capture data, temporal and spatial data, and projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dublin Core&lt;/code&gt; â€“ One of the best known and widely used domain-agnostic metadata standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ecological Metadata Language&lt;/code&gt; â€“ Standard developed for and by the ecology discipline. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) metadata application profile is primarily based on the EML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ISO 19115&lt;/code&gt; â€“ An internationally-adopted schema for describing geographic information and services. Its core elements provide information about the identification, extent, quality, temporal and spatial references. The EU INSPIRE metadata recommendations are based ISO 19115.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PREMIS Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata&lt;/code&gt; â€“  International standard to support the preservation of digital objects and ensure their long-term usability.&lt;/p&gt;

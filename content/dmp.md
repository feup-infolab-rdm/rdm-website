A data management plan is a formal document that describes how the data will be handled during a project and after its conclusion. The DMP is intended to cover all the steps of the data life cycle, namely how the data is discovered, collected and organized. Moreover it concerns topics on data quality, preservation and dissemination. Here we can find examples of the DMP and tools which help to creat your a Data Management Plan for your data. 

## 1. Data Management Planning Tool Online - Create, review, and share data management plans that meet institutional and funder requirements.

[The DMPtool] (https://dmptool.org/) is free and helps researchers to create DMP. This tool can be used to develop generic plans, yet it provide guidance from specific funders who require DMP.

## 2. DMPonline tools has been developed by the Digital Curation Centre [DCC] (http://www.dcc.ac.uk/) to help you write data maganement plans.

[DMPonline] (https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/) displays different templates that represent the requirements of different funders and institutions, offering support to write a DMP.

## 3. H2020 Programme Guidelines on FAIR Data Management in Horizon 2020.

The European Commision, under the H2020 Programme, promotes the [Guidelines] (http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf) on FAIR Data Management, in order to helps its beneficiaries to make their data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.

## 4. Checklist for a Data Management Plan.
 
[The DCC ] (http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP/DMP_Checklist_2013.pdf) synthesises requirements for data management plans and best practices within the wider community. This allows us to provide a checklist that presents the main questions or themes that researchers may want to cover when writing a DMP.

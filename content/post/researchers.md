RESEARCHERS
How do I get credit for my data?

The publication of research data helps to increase the visibility and accessibility of all research results. The reuse of data favours their citation and that of associated papers. The academic and scientific community is now more motivated to recognize non-standard research outputs such as data, code and professional network activities. Sharing data can also foster the partnership with other researchers or institutions.
Why should I spend extra time managing my data, now that my results are out?

More and more, the time for data management will be distributed from the project proposal to the final presentation of results. But for important results where your research has impact, you can invest in preparing and publishing datasets, improving your visibility.
Are my data safe in the repository?

You should be concerned with that, and look for a trusted digital repository for your data. In case that is not available, you need to assess the plans and the expected evolution of the repository you are planning to use. There are some initiatives, such as the Data Seal of Approval, that certify data repositories.
If I adopt Dendro and your processes, what extra effort do I have to account for in my project?

If you already have data that are generated and shared in your project, you are already using project manpower in RDM, albeit informally. You can improve your process with the Dendro workflow, creating metadata according to the standards in your domain and preparing the datasets to be ready for publication any time you decide.
Why do I need to describe my data?

Data in a repository can be hard to find and, when someone finds them and wants to reuse them, they need to know about the data production context. Considering that research data, unlike publications, may provide no clue as to its nature, resorting to metadata will promote data discovery, interpretation, preservation and further reuse.

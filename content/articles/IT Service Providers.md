## Which research data management platforms are available?

A set of data repositories are currently available to support research data management. With many data repositories to choose from it can be difficult to choose a suitable platform that meet the research data management requirements of an institution, research group or a single researcher.

Our RDM team is developing the Dendro platform, a staging area to engage researcher in the management and description of their data at the early stages of the research workflow. Once the data is ready to be published, Dendro is capable of exporting the enclosed datasets and metadata records to research data repositories.

Services like [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) and [Zenodo] (https://zenodo.org/), delegate platform maintenance for a fee, while platforms such as [CKAN] (http://ckan.org/), [DSpace](http://www.dspace.org/) and [ePrints](http://www.eprints.org/uk/) can be installed and run completely under the control of the research institution. As to [EUDAT](https://www.eudat.eu/) it offers several research data services.

The Registry of Research Data Repositories ([re3data.org](http://www.re3data.org/)) covers a wide range of discipline data repositories.

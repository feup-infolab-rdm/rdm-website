## What data should be deposited?

As a minimum, you should deposit research data that are expected to be valuable to others, that can testify and validate your findings, and that helps you increase your recognition in the community. If the data are unique or expensive to generate, this is an indication that it may become a valuable asset. Moreover, the contract of your project or the rules of your funding agency may require data deposit.

## What is data curation?

Data curation involves maintaining, preserving and adding value to data research troughout the data life cycle, reducing the threat of devaluation, or even data loss. It also reduces duplication of effort in creating research data, freeing researchers to other activities.

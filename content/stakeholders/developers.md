## What is Dendro?

Created at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, Dendro focuses on providing researchers with a collaborative, structured and standards-compliant research data management platform. Dendro aims to support researchers in their daily data management activities, allowing users to describe their data using domain-specific ontologies, promoting research data integration in the Semantic Web.

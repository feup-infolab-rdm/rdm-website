## 1. What is the Universidade do Porto data repository? 

The Universidade do Porto data repository, based on the CKAN platform, enables researchers to deposit, find, share and reuse research data from diverse specific domains. Moreover, the research data deposited in this data repository are gathered by the RE3data.org directory.

## 2. What are the EUDAT and the eB2SHARE?

EUDAT is a collaborative european infrastructure that enables researchers, from any discipline, to securely share and preserve their research data. The EUDAT mission is to consolidate the research infrastructures and e-infrastructures with an active engagement strategy.

B2SHARE is an web-based EUDAT service that allows the deposit, search and share small datasets.

## 3.Which are the advantages of deposit research data in a data repository?

The main advantages are the promotion of the research outputs; the reuse opportunities; it facilitates data citation and of the related paper; peer recognition; it promotes collaboration between researchers and, or, institutions.

## 4. Do I need to describe my research data to share it?

Yes. When the research data are deposited it is ideal to provide additional information about it. This means providing contextual information, through metadata, so others can find, interpret and reuse the deposited data. The Dendro platform supports the creation metadata records and export them, together with the datasets, to data repositories.

## 5. In which format can I deposit research data in the Universidade do Porto data repository and in EUDAT B2SHARE?

There are no format restrictions to research deposit in these data repositories.

## 6. Which is the maximum dataset size allowed for deposit in the Universidade do Porto data repository and in EUDAT B2SHARE?

1Gb is the maximum allowed. However, it is advisable to contact the data repository managers for exceptions.

## 7. Which type of creative commons licens exists?

## 8. Where can I find more about metadata standards?

A list of available metadata standards for research data description is published by the Digital Curation Centre: http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards

## 9. I cannot find a metadata standard for the description of my data, what can I do?
For many disciplines there are no available metadata standards. Please contact us, so we can help you find a suitable metadata standard, or developed a metadata model tailored for your needs.
